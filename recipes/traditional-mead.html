        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>12 pounds unprocessed honey</li>
            <li>5 gallons spring water</li>
            <li>2 packets of dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons yeast nutrient</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><p>Heat 2 gallons of spring water to <strong>160°F</strong> in a large kettle and remove from heat. Add yeast nutrient and the unprocessed honey, and then stir until thoroughly dissolved.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer kettle back to heat and bring back to <strong>160°F</strong>; maintain this temperature for <strong>30 minutes.</strong> Skim off any foam that accumulates.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove from heat and let cool;<strong>add 1 to 2 gallons</strong> spring water to quickly bring the temperature back down below <strong>90°F.</strong> Transfer must to primary fermentation chamber and aerate by shaking or stirring for <strong>5 minutes.</strong> Start yeast per packet instructions before pitching into must.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add fermentation lock and store in a cool dark place for <strong>14 to 28 days.</strong> When you see one bubble every <strong>60 seconds,</strong> primary fermentation has concluded.</p></li>
            <li><p>Rack the mead into the secondary fermentation chamber and store in a cool dark place for <strong>2 to 4 months.</strong> Sample the mead and bottle once it has achieved an acceptable level of clarity and shows no signs of fermentation.</p></li>
