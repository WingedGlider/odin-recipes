        <h2>Simple Bread Made from Oats and Barley</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>900 grams of a mixture of wheat, barley, oat, and rye flour</li>
            <li>3 cups of buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 dash of salt</li>
            <li>½ cup of honey</li>
            <li>1 cup of chopped nuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Mix and knead the ingredients thoroughly. Use an electric mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough, as the ingredients are dense, making it hard to mix by hand.</p></li>
            <li><p>Using your hands covered with flour, form the dough into small balls, about <strong>2-3 inches in diameter (5-8 cm).</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>To bake, press the balls flat, about <strong>½ inch thick (1 cm)</strong>, on a flat pan greased with butter over the fire. Turn the bread once to cook on both sides.</p></li>
            <li><p> When done, the bread is light brown and sounds hollow when tapped, about <strong>2-3 minutes on each side.</strong> Eat warm.</p></li>
        </ol>
